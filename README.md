### Summary

Being introduced to Gatsby was a joy and definitely see how it can be used to get something up and running quickly. My blog is actually using gatsby so this introduction was a lot of review but I enjoyed being walked through it. 

If I wanted to build a static site with React quickly, Gatsby makes a lot of sense to me.
